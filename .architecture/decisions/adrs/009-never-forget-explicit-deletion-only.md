# ADR-009: Never-Forget Philosophy with Explicit Deletion

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-10-25

**Decision Makers**: Dewayne VanHoozer, Claude (Anthropic)

## Context

Traditional memory systems for LLMs face a critical design decision: when should memories be deleted?

Alternative approaches:

1. **Automatic deletion**: LRU cache eviction, TTL expiration, capacity limits
2. **Never delete**: Unlimited growth, storage costs, degraded performance
3. **Manual deletion**: User explicitly deletes memories
4. **Hybrid**: Automatic archival + manual deletion for permanent removal

Key challenges:

- **LLM context loss**: Deleting memories loses valuable knowledge
- **User surprise**: Automatic deletion feels like "forgetting" without consent
- **Debugging**: Hard to debug if memories disappear automatically
- **Storage costs**: Unlimited storage is expensive
- **Performance**: Large datasets slow down queries

HTM's core purpose is to provide **persistent, never-forgetting memory** for LLM robots. The philosophy: "never forget unless explicitly told."

## Decision

We will implement a **never-forget philosophy** where:

1. ✅ **Memories are never automatically deleted**
2. ✅ **Eviction only moves memories from working → long-term storage**
3. ✅ **Deletion requires explicit user confirmation**
4. ✅ **Confirmation must be `:confirmed` symbol to prevent accidental deletion**
5. ✅ **All deletions are logged for audit trail**

### Deletion API

```ruby
# Attempting to delete without confirmation raises error
htm.forget("key_to_delete")
# => ArgumentError: Must pass confirm: :confirmed to delete

# Explicit confirmation required
htm.forget("key_to_delete", confirm: :confirmed)
# => true (deleted successfully)
```

### Implementation

```ruby
def forget(key, confirm: false)
  raise ArgumentError, "Must pass confirm: :confirmed to delete" unless confirm == :confirmed

  node_id = @long_term_memory.get_node_id(key)

  # Log operation BEFORE deleting (audit trail)
  @long_term_memory.log_operation(
    operation: 'forget',
    node_id: node_id,
    robot_id: @robot_id,
    details: { key: key }
  )

  # Delete from long-term memory and working memory
  @long_term_memory.delete(key)
  @working_memory.remove(key)

  update_robot_activity
  true
end
```

### Eviction vs Deletion

**Eviction (automatic, safe)**:
- Triggered by working memory capacity limit
- Moves memories from working memory → long-term memory
- NO data loss, memories remain recallable
- Logged as 'evict' operation

**Deletion (explicit, destructive)**:
- Triggered only by user calling `forget(confirm: :confirmed)`
- Removes memory from both working and long-term storage
- PERMANENT data loss
- Logged as 'forget' operation

## Rationale

### Why Never-Forget?

**LLMs need long-term context**:
- Architectural decisions made months ago still matter
- User preferences should persist across sessions
- Bug fixes and resolutions are valuable knowledge
- Conversation history builds understanding over time

**Automatic deletion causes problems**:
- ❌ **Surprise**: User asks "didn't we discuss this?" → memory gone
- ❌ **Debugging**: Can't debug deleted memories
- ❌ **Inconsistency**: Same query returns different results over time
- ❌ **Lost knowledge**: Critical information disappears silently

**Two-tier architecture enables never-forget**:
- Working memory: Token-limited, evicts to long-term
- Long-term memory: Unlimited, persistent PostgreSQL
- Eviction ≠ deletion, just moves to cold storage
- Recall brings memories back to working memory

### Why Explicit Confirmation?

**Prevent accidental deletion**:
```ruby
# Easy typo or mistake
htm.forget("important_key")  # REJECTED - raises error

# Must be intentional
htm.forget("important_key", confirm: :confirmed)  # Allowed
```

**Confirmation is a speed bump**:
- Forces user to think before deleting
- Symbol `:confirmed` (not boolean) prevents `confirm: true` shortcuts
- Clear intent signal in code review

**Audit trail for safety**:
- All deletions logged with robot_id and timestamp
- Can investigate "who deleted this?"
- Provides recovery information (log has the deleted value)

### Why Log Before Deleting?

**Foreign key constraint safety**:
```ruby
# Log operation BEFORE deleting
@long_term_memory.log_operation(
  operation: 'forget',
  node_id: node_id,  # Still exists
  robot_id: @robot_id,
  details: { key: key }
)

# Now safe to delete
@long_term_memory.delete(key)
```

**Audit trail preservation**:
- Deletion log entry survives even if something goes wrong
- Can reconstruct what was deleted and when
- Supports future "undo delete" feature

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Never lose knowledge**: Memories persist unless explicitly deleted
✅ **Predictable behavior**: No surprise deletions, no data loss
✅ **Debugging friendly**: All memories available for analysis
✅ **Audit trail**: Every deletion logged with who/when/what
✅ **Safe eviction**: Working memory overflow doesn't lose data
✅ **Recallable**: Evicted memories return via recall()
✅ **Intentional deletion**: Confirmation prevents accidents

### Negative

❌ **Unbounded growth**: Database grows indefinitely without cleanup
❌ **Storage costs**: Long-term storage has financial cost
❌ **Query performance**: Larger datasets slow down searches
❌ **Manual cleanup**: User must periodically delete unneeded memories
❌ **No automatic expiration**: Can't set TTL for temporary memories
❌ **Privacy concerns**: Sensitive data persists until deleted

### Neutral

➡️ **User responsibility**: User must manage memory lifecycle
➡️ **Explicit is better**: Pythonic philosophy, clear intent
➡️ **Retention policies**: Future feature, not v1

## Design Decisions

### Decision: Confirmation Symbol (`:confirmed`) Instead of Boolean
**Rationale**:

- Boolean `confirm: true` is too easy to add casually
- Symbol `:confirmed` requires deliberate intent
- Harder to accidentally pass `true` vs `:confirmed`

**Alternative**: `confirm: true`
**Rejected**: Too casual, easy to misuse

**Alternative**: `confirm: "I am sure"`
**Rejected**: String matching is fragile

### Decision: Raise Error on Missing Confirmation
**Rationale**: Fail-safe default, loud failure prevents data loss

```ruby
htm.forget("key")  # Raises ArgumentError
```

**Alternative**: Silently ignore (return false)
**Rejected**: Silent failures are dangerous

**Alternative**: Prompt user for confirmation
**Rejected**: Not appropriate for library code

### Decision: Log Before Delete (Not After)
**Rationale**: Avoid foreign key constraint violations

**Alternative**: Log after delete
**Rejected**: Foreign key violation if node_id referenced

**Alternative**: Allow NULL node_id in logs
**Rejected**: Lose referential integrity

### Decision: Eviction Preserves in Long-Term Memory
**Rationale**: Core never-forget philosophy

**Alternative**: Eviction = deletion
**Rejected**: Violates never-forget principle

**Alternative**: Archive to separate table
**Deferred**: Can optimize with archival tables later

### Decision: No TTL (Time-To-Live) Feature
**Rationale**: Simplicity, never-forget philosophy

**Alternative**: Optional TTL per memory
**Deferred**: Can add later if needed

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Accidental Deletion Attempt
```ruby
# User typo or mistake
htm.forget("important_decision")

# Result: ArgumentError raised
# => ArgumentError: Must pass confirm: :confirmed to delete

# Memory remains safe
```

### Use Case 2: Intentional Deletion
```ruby
# User wants to delete temporary test data
htm.add_node("test_key", "temporary test data", importance: 1.0)

# Later: delete intentionally
htm.forget("test_key", confirm: :confirmed)
# => true (deleted)

# Deletion logged for audit trail
```

### Use Case 3: Eviction (Not Deletion)
```ruby
# Working memory full (128,000 tokens)
# Add large new memory (10,000 tokens)

htm.add_node("new_large_memory", large_text, importance: 7.0)

# Result: HTM evicts low-importance memories to make space
# Evicted memories moved to long-term storage (NOT deleted)
# Can be recalled later:

memories = htm.recall(timeframe: "last month", topic: "evicted topic")
# => Evicted memories returned
```

### Use Case 4: Audit Trail Query
```ruby
# Who deleted this memory?
deleted_logs = db.exec(<<~SQL)
  SELECT robot_id, created_at, details
  FROM operations_log
  WHERE operation = 'forget'
  AND details->>'key' = 'important_key'
SQL

# Result:
# robot_id: "f47ac10b-..."
# created_at: 2025-10-25 14:32:15
# details: {"key": "important_key"}
```

### Use Case 5: Bulk Cleanup (Manual)
```ruby
# User wants to clean up old test data
test_keys = [
  "test_001",
  "test_002",
  "test_003"
]

test_keys.each do |key|
  htm.forget(key, confirm: :confirmed)
end

# All deletions logged individually
# User must explicitly confirm each deletion
```

### Use Case 6: Never-Forget in Practice
```ruby
# Session 1: Important decision
htm.add_node("decision_001",
             "We decided to use PostgreSQL for HTM storage",
             type: :decision,
             importance: 10.0)

# ... 90 days later, many sessions, many memories added ...
# Working memory evicted this decision to long-term storage

# Session 100: User asks about database choice
memories = htm.recall(timeframe: "last 3 months", topic: "database storage")

# Result: Decision recalled from long-term memory
# Never forgotten, always available
```

## Deletion Lifecycle

### 1. User Initiates Deletion
```ruby
htm.forget("key_to_delete", confirm: :confirmed)
```

### 2. Validation
```ruby
raise ArgumentError, "Must pass confirm: :confirmed to delete" unless confirm == :confirmed
```

### 3. Retrieve Node ID
```ruby
node_id = @long_term_memory.get_node_id("key_to_delete")
# => 42
```

### 4. Log Operation (Before Deletion)
```ruby
@long_term_memory.log_operation(
  operation: 'forget',
  node_id: 42,  # Still exists at this point
  robot_id: @robot_id,
  details: { key: "key_to_delete" }
)
```

### 5. Delete from Long-Term Memory
```sql
DELETE FROM nodes WHERE key = 'key_to_delete'

-- Cascades to:
-- - relationships (foreign key cascade)
-- - tags (foreign key cascade)
```

### 6. Remove from Working Memory
```ruby
@working_memory.remove("key_to_delete")
```

### 7. Update Robot Activity
```ruby
@long_term_memory.update_robot_activity(@robot_id)
```

### 8. Return Success
```ruby
return true
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Deletion Performance

- **Node ID lookup**: O(log n) with index on key
- **Log operation**: O(1) insert
- **Delete query**: O(1) with primary key
- **Cascade deletes**: O(m) where m = related records
- **Working memory remove**: O(1) hash delete
- **Total**: < 10ms for typical deletion

### Audit Log Growth

- **One log entry per deletion**: Minimal overhead
- **Log table indexed**: Fast queries by operation, robot_id, timestamp
- **Partitioning**: Can partition by timestamp if needed

### Storage Growth (Never-Forget)

- **Long-term memory**: Grows unbounded without cleanup
- **Typical growth**: ~100-1000 nodes per day (varies widely)
- **Storage**: ~1-10 KB per node (text + embedding)
- **Annual growth estimate**: ~365-3650 MB per year

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Unbounded Storage Growth

- **Risk**: Database grows indefinitely, storage costs increase
- **Likelihood**: High (by design, never-forget)
- **Impact**: Medium (storage costs, query slowdown)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Monitor database size
  - Implement archival strategies (future)
  - Document cleanup procedures
  - Compression policies (TimescaleDB)
  - User-driven cleanup with bulk delete utilities

### Risk: Accidental Deletion Despite Confirmation

- **Risk**: User confirms deletion by mistake
- **Likelihood**: Low (confirmation is speed bump)
- **Impact**: High (permanent data loss)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Audit log preserves what was deleted
  - Future: "undo delete" within time window
  - Future: "soft delete" with archival table
  - Document deletion is permanent

### Risk: Performance Degradation

- **Risk**: Large dataset slows down queries
- **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on usage)
- **Impact**: Medium (slower recall)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Indexes on key, robot_id, created_at, embedding
  - TimescaleDB compression for old data
  - Archival to separate table (future)
  - Partitioning by time range

### Risk: Privacy Concerns

- **Risk**: Sensitive data persists indefinitely
- **Likelihood**: Medium (users may store sensitive info)
- **Impact**: High (privacy violation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Document data retention clearly
  - Provide secure deletion utilities
  - Encryption at rest (PostgreSQL)
  - User awareness of never-forget philosophy

## Future Enhancements

### Soft Delete (Archival)
```ruby
# Mark as deleted instead of hard delete
htm.archive("key_to_archive", confirm: :confirmed)

# Archived memories excluded from queries
# But recoverable if needed
htm.unarchive("key_to_archive")
```

### Undo Delete (Time Window)
```ruby
# Soft delete with 30-day recovery window
htm.forget("key", confirm: :confirmed)

# Within 30 days: undo
htm.undo_forget("key")

# After 30 days: permanent deletion
```

### Retention Policies
```ruby
# Automatic archival based on age and importance
htm.configure_retention(
  archive_after_days: 365,
  min_importance: 5.0  # Don't archive high-importance
)
```

### Bulk Delete Utilities
```ruby
# Delete all nodes matching criteria
HTM::Cleanup.delete_by_tag("temporary", confirm: :confirmed)
HTM::Cleanup.delete_older_than(1.year.ago, confirm: :confirmed)
HTM::Cleanup.delete_by_robot("robot-123", confirm: :confirmed)
```

### Encryption for Sensitive Data
```ruby
# Encrypt sensitive memories
htm.add_node("api_key", sensitive_value,
             encrypt: true,
             importance: 10.0)

# Automatically encrypted in database
# Decrypted on retrieval
```

### Audit Log Analysis
```ruby
# Analyze deletion patterns
HTM::Analytics.deletion_report(timeframe: "last month")

# Who deletes the most?
# What types of memories are deleted?
# When are deletions happening?
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Automatic TTL (Time-To-Live)
**Pros**: Automatic cleanup, predictable storage
**Cons**: Violates never-forget, surprise deletions
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - contradicts core philosophy

### LRU Cache Eviction with Deletion
**Pros**: Simple, automatic capacity management
**Cons**: Data loss, surprise deletions
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - eviction should not delete

### No Deletion API (Truly Never Delete)
**Pros**: Simplest never-forget implementation
**Cons**: No escape hatch for mistakes, privacy issues
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - need explicit deletion for edge cases

### Confirmation via Prompt
**Pros**: Most user-friendly, hard to misuse
**Cons**: Not appropriate for library code, breaks automation
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - library should not prompt

### Soft Delete by Default
**Pros**: Recoverable, safer than hard delete
**Cons**: Complexity, storage overhead, unclear semantics
**Decision**: 🔄 Deferred - consider for v2
